# java_fizzBuzz

## FizzBuzz
Write a program that will take an integer and print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz if the number is divisible by 5, FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, and the number itself for all other cases.

**Objectives:**

● Practice conditionals.

● Implement a classic interview algorithm.

**Tasks:**

● Create a FizzBuzz class that implements the following logic:
```java
public class FizzBuzz {
    public String fizzBuzz(int number) {
        // fizzbuzz logic here
    }
}
```
Output for 3:

```java
Fizz
```
Output for 5:

```java
Buzz
```
Output for 15:

```java
FizzBuzz
```
Output for 2:

```java
2
```
● Create a FizzBuzzTest class that you will use to check the outputs of the fizzBuzz() method.
